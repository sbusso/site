title: From monitoring to public status
---



Completing the [Monitoring Application post](http://rubynaut.net/2012/08/30/application-monitoring), some companies go a bit further, offering a public dashboard to their users to check the status of their services. So monitoring is not only about private information, it's also about communication to your customers. Some examples:
* [Github](https://status.github.com/)
* [Disqus](http://status.disqus.com/)
* [heroku](https://status.heroku.com/)
* [Diablo III](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/status)
* [AWS status](http://status.aws.amazon.com/)
* [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/appsstatus)
* And finally an aggregator [Api Status](http://api-status.com/)
