title: Twitter Bootstrap 2.1 on Rails
---



So Twitter Bootstrap is out with new features as the new [Affix side bar](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#affix) and so is [twitter bootstrap rails](https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails#want-to-donate) gem. Using [bootstrap sass](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass), for more flexibility, I will need to wait a little bit.

Pay attention on other [changes](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/wiki/Changelog) as the default font size / line height.

Don't forget to use [font awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) [gem](https://github.com/littlebtc/font-awesome-sass-rails) to replace defaults icons by a more flexible vecorial font system (easy to change size and color), no code change requirered.
