title: Migrate comments to disqus
---



I did it! After some days, I can move all the old comments to disqus and then link them to the webby posts. Here is the rake task:

"export_comment_to_disqus.rb":http://gist.github.com/347114

Also you need to install the update disqus gem (API ver. 1.1) from my repo or link the lib, it fixes small things need to make the export works:

"disqus lib":http://github.com/sbusso/disqus
