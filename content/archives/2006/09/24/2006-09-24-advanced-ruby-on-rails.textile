<h2> Ruby on Rails Backend </h2>

Have you ever though to have quicker site setting up with Ruby on Rails ? Each time I want to start a project I do design first same things: a backend.

    * Manage your data
    * Authentification system

And for all that you need of course a nice layout. Do you know something can do that out of the box ? let me know, untill I find this I will try to make something like that.

<h2> Zope on Rails</h2>

To go further, you can add some good stuff like :

    *  Workflow / machine state system
    * A mini CMS with a flexible content with inline editor
    * Indexing engine, tag system
    * Navigation
    * Cache
    * eCommerce system with checkout and payment system
    * Upload system / File system Handler
    * Widgets

Most of these features exist. Then It s possible to have an extended framework with Ruby on Rails, just have to be done.
