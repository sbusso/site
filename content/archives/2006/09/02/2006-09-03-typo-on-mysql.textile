title: Typo on mysql
---



The default installation is done with a sqlite database. After a corruption of this database I decided to migrate to mysql ... It was not a piece of cake.

For those you want to use mysql u should install typo as following :

   $ typo install <i>directory</i> database=mysql

Then you will have the installation starting and ending with an error. But you have already a project created.

Execute the db/schema.mysql.sql on your database.

Modify the config/database.yml as you need and relaunch the install. Now the installtion go to the end, set up databse and start mongrel.

That's all.
