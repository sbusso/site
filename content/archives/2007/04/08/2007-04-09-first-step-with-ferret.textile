title: First step with Ferret

If you don't want to lost your time (_about 2 hours for me_), don't understand why your change in your model are not taking in account, and then understand there with a thread that's cannot be killed then block you model, _*create the ferret index at startup*_

In your <code>environment.rb</code>:

<typo:code lang="ruby">require 'ferret'
include Ferret
FERRET_INDEX = Index::Index.new(:path => FERRET_INDEX_DIR)
</pre>

With <code>FERRET_INDEX_DIR</code> is the path to your index directory and then you can use <code>FERRET_INDEX</code> whereever you want in your application. Later I will deal with how to initialize my index :p
