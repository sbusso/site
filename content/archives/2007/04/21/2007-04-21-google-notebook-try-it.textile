*Yet another Google tool*

I've just discovered about the notebook tool in google. Why I didn't know this earlier? it's exactly what I need to grab and store information from Internet, with the firefox extension you can clip, comment what ever page you want. I know about Clip it! or other page grabber but this one is just _simple_, and well integrated.

A very good tool to share your clips from a computer to another, try it !
