The conference has just finished, and the first thing to say "it's a must go conference for all of you developing with Rails". These 3 days were plenty of good information and teaching. You can read a lot of things on feeds or blogs, train yourself about every thing in Rails but nothing worth the real contact with the community. -500- 750 participants but only 2% of french people "mais ou est la communautÃ© francaise rails ?" and 95% of Mac users :D. Berlin is quite pretty city to visit, that's was a good _plus_ :).

I will write a serie of posts about some interesting conferences I attended to :

 * Scaling rails app
 * Security (website)
 * Capistrano 2.0 (you should use it)
 * RSpec and its stories (good ideas, the best is coming)
 * Tavnav and other italian widgets (DRY)
 * Rails 2.0 RC (not a revolution, but many nice evolutions)

and maybe another one about feedback of business creation around rails app.

Other subjects I have watched but will not write about:

 * Good practises (no big stuff)
 * Ferret (previous post)
 * Presenter concept (maybe a good idea but not convinced by the presentation)
 * REST (already covered by many posts)

I have been disappointed by one thing, there weren't any RadiantCMS talk :(.
