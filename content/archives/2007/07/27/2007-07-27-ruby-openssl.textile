title: Ruby and OpenSSL on Ubuntu
---



If you try to use scrubyt or mechanize on ubuntu you could get some error like:

<code>no such file to load -- openssl</code>

After having installed Opensll via apt-get you will also need *libssl_dev*.

<code>sudo apt-get openssl libssl-dev</code>

Then now go to the ruby source folder, and in openssl extension folder: /.../ruby1.8/ext/openssl

<code><pre>ruby extconf.rb
make
sudo make install</pre></code>

check your installation with <code>ruby -rubygems -e "require 'mechanize'"</code>
