title: Webby as a powerful wiki-like notebook
---



h1. Introduction

I have often look at wikis, trying to find a nice tool for taking my notes and formating them. Have many ideas in my head, like to write them down and visualize it. Wiki is great for that but always a bit heavy to "deploy".

Continuesly seeking for new ruby things, I heard about "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org/, a lightweight web publishing system. Simply taking your pages (textile, html, erb, aso...) and generate a static website. Run "Heel":http://copiousfreetime.rubyforge.org/heel/ on it and you will have a perfect light but very powerful wiki-like web site. Extension are perfect for programming notes including graphiz and syntax highlighting.

h2. Setup your notebook

<pre>
sudo gem install webby
</pre>

This will install several gems, included heel.
