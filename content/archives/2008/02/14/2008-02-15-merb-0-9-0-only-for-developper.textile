title: Merb 0.9.0 - only for developer
---



Following the next version of Merb, I'm a bit surprised by the way this new version came out:

"Merb 0.9.0":http://gweezlebur.com/2008/2/14/merb-0-9-0-released-kinda

Help of developers is needed for going on 1.0, then install it and try it.

Included :

 * merb-core
 * merb-action-args
 * merb-assets
 * merb-gen
 * merb-haml
 * merb-mailer
 * merb-parts
 * merb-more
 * merb

then
<pre>
merb-gen myapp
</pre>
