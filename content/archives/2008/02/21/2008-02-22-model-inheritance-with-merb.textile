title: Model inheritance with Merb
---



_from help on irc#merb_

I had recurrent issue about inherit a model class from another one in Merb, using ActiveRecord or DataMapper. As it's 'magicly' done on Rails I though the same way in Merb, but the last one load model class in alpha order. then what you have to do is to load the first class with a require:

in your first file:

<pre>
class Page < ActiveRecord::Base
end
</pre>

then in second add the require:

<pre>
require 'page'

class ActivePage < Page
end
</pre>

Simply using ruby...
