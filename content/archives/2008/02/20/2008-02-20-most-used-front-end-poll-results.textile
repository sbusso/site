title: 'Most used front end: poll results '
---



For severals month now I put a poll about which front end people use for their website. Even if it s not a reference with only 85 votes I would like to publsih some result. Of course as the content of this website is ruby oriented, then the results will be also.

First it started with most of votes for apache. At the end Apache it's still the  first:

 * 47%: apache
 * 40%: nginx
 * 7% : lighttpd
 * 5% : others

The result for nginx is over general real stats but for the trend is here and nginx is more and more the choice for a ruby stack as I did present in my "last post":http://www.rubynaut.net/articles/2008/02/19/railsconf-scaling-a-rails-app-part-3-of-3
