Git is different from svn and create a private repository on a remote server too. No need of gitosis or git-daemon for this.

I start from an existing project and a server I already access to with ssh key.

First, initialize git in your project:

<pre>git init
git add .
git commit -m 'initial import'</pre>

[update]

-Then create a git copy of your project into a git archive _my_project_folder.git_.-

-git clone --bare my_project_folder my_project_folder.git-

Copy -this archive- the .git folder to your remote server:

<pre>scp -rp .git user@server://path/to/repositories/my_project_folder.git</pre>

Add this new repository in the config of your local project:

<pre>git remote add my_remote_repo ssh://server/path/to/repositories/my_project_folder.git</pre>

You're done. After a change you can commit and then push your change to the remote repo:

<pre>git commit -m "message for change log"
git push my_remote_repo</pre>

Use your own parameters for:

 * _my_project_folder_ with the folder of your project
 * _path/to/repositories_ with the path to your repository on the remote server
 * _my_project_repo_ with the name you want for the remote repository, usually _origin_

If you need a public repository, have look to gitosis or git-daemon. Best is Github.
