title: Don't use "disable with text" option with your jquery ajax binding
---



I ve just spent 5 hours to understand what was going wrong with my ajaxy form. I use jquery on rails and ajaxForm plugin, I have some form already working good and tried to a new one.

But this time it doesnt work, I dont understand why my form send twice the request, first with ajax header and second time with html request. I even tried to write raw javascrit, livequery and so on. Nothing make it works. Finally I want to check a little thing I add on the form: 'disable with text' option. I disabled it and miracle it works now.

I ve lost 5 hour of my time for this little cosmetic tool that s mess up ajax binding.

Then my advice: DON'T USE "DISABLE WITH TEXT" OPTION WITH YOUR JQUERY AJAX BINDING.
